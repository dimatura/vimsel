# Vimsel: Vim/Visual Image Select

You're writing a paper (in `LaTeX`, using `vim`, of course) and you have to
insert a figure for `n03d3bc_ff2828e.png`. That's really annoying to remember
and type.  So you just type `:Vimsel`, and an
[`sxiv`](https://github.com/muennich/sxiv) instance pops up. You select the
image you want with `m`, close `sxiv`, and the image name is magically inserted
in your `.tex` file. Amazing.

Beware: this is pre-alpha and I don't know anything about vimscript.
You will need to have `sxiv` installed and in your path.
